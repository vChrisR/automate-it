Today my first ever [whitepaper](http://itq.nl/the-why-what-and-how-of-automation/) was published. It's titled: The why, What and how of Automation. Here is the teaser:

> The current digitization wave puts an ever increasing load on enterprise IT departments. At the same time the business is expecting shorter delivery times for IT services just to stay ahead of the competition. To keep delivering the right services on time enterprise IT needs a high degree of automation.

The whitepaper explains why automation is so important, what you need to automate and how this can be done. Those who attended my NLVMUG session might notice that this whitepaper has the same title as my presentation. That's obviously not a coincidence. If you missed the session make sure to download and read the whitepaper here: [http://itq.nl/the-why-what-and-how-of-automation/](http://itq.nl/the-why-what-and-how-of-automation/) I'll be posting a few more blogs on some of the topics in the whitepaper as well so stay tuned :).
