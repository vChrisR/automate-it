A few weeks ago the annual Dutch VMUG UserCon took place. For the first time this year it was a 2 day event. During the pre-con day there were 3 VMware R&D sessions, a VCDX workshop and a hackathon. I took part in the hackathon and together with my colleagues Martin, Ruurd and Sander we managed to deploy minecraft servers by talking to Alexa. Pretty neat. Source code is [here](https://github.com/orangeglasses/vmug-hackathon). At the conference day I presented a talk together with [Martin Caarels](https://blog.caarels.com/). It was an introduction to BOSH. If you're interested, the video is below. It's in Dutch though. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMu1S4mPGSc&t=1798s
