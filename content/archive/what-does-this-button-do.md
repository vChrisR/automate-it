Dennis and I will be presenting at the [NLVMUG Event](http://www.nlvmug.com/) on March 19 2015. We will talk about automation in general, how to optimize for automation, how cool docker is and we'll be doing some awesome interactive demo's. This year we won't take a 3D printed datacenter with us. Instead we'll take our magic button with us. It's battery powered, Wifi connected and looks like this: [![2015-02-17 23.54.44](http://www.automate-it.today/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-02-17-23.54.44-300x168.jpg)](http://www.automate-it.today/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2015-02-17-23.54.44.jpg) What does this button do? join us on March 19th to find out.
