Installing vCloud Automation Center (vCAC) can be a challenging task. After doing several installations we found out that some people, just like us, struggle with the configuration.

A while ago I created some workflows which describe al the necessary steps in this configuration. I thought this would be nice to share with you, as a guideline in the configuration.

Each vCAC configuration step is clickable and will lead you to a separate blog post, with a flowchart and more information about this step.
