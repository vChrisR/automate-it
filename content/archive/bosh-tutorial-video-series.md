I am trying something new: I am starting a [BOSH](http://bosh.io) tutorial video series. So instead of writing about BOSH on this blog I'll be talking about BOSH on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-KDnH1SSeS6tfeaPZidInQ). Today I am releasing the [first](https://youtu.be/goSYBc0_724) video and I plan to get more videos out in the following weeks. I start out by explaining what BOSH is, why you need it and what the main concepts are. In the second video I will show you how to deploy your own BOSH Director and in the following videos I will use that director to show you how to deploy software, manage your deployments and troubleshoot problems. So keep an eye on the [_BOSH Rocks_](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-KDnH1SSeS6tfeaPZidInQ) youtube channel and I'll tell you everything about BOSH! \[embed\]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goSYBc0\_724\[/embed\] \[embed\]https://youtu.be/FqAk5ds\_NVo\[/embed\]
