Just placing knowledge base articles on our blog is not our focus, but sometimes you stumble upon a interesting one. This article describes that tenants will become inaccessible and identity stores will disappear after deploying a template in vCAC. And because it’s about vCloud Automation Center it’s reason enough to share this with you. The first issue mentioned in the article:

*   When attempting to log into a tenant, a blank page is displayed with a **Submit** button in the upper left corner.

Can also have to do with an other known issue with vCAC 6.0.  It's about the maximum header size (8K) for vCAC server HTTP request, this is fixed in the 6.0.1. release. Read more info: [**kb**.vmware.com/**kb**/**2075011**](http://kb.vmware.com/kb/2075011 "kb.vmware.com/kb/2075011")
