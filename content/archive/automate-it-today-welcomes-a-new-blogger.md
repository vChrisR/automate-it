[![Avatar_klein](http://automate-it.today/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Avatar_klein-150x150.png)](http://automate-it.today/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Avatar_klein.png) Our colleague [Olivier Bootsma](https://twitter.com/vOrchestrator) will be joining us here at automate-it.today. Olivier has a lot of vRealize Orchestrator experience so his contributions will be a very valuable addition to this blog. We are expecting his first contributions shortly. Olivier and I will be delivering a vRO bootcamp during the [NLVMUG UserCon](http://www.nlvmug.com/agenda/ "nlvmug") on march 17th. So you'll be able to meet him in person if you're attending the biggest VMUG UserCon in the world.
