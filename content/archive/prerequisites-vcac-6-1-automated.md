As many of you already know VMware [released](%20http://automate-it.today/vcac-6-1-released/) vCloud Automation Center 6.1 September 9th. I'm working on an implementation already, so I feel pretty lucky. An installation always starts with the deployment of the necessary Windows (2012R2) servers and all the prerequisites listed in the documentation.

We at automate-it.today are big supporters in automating everything, as long as it useful or fun to build. So I was really excited about the pre-req automation script build by Brain Graf. It's easy, it's fast and will give you a good verification of all the necessary prerequisites.

You can find the script [here](http://blogs.vmware.com/PowerCLI/2014/09/vcac-6-1-pre-req-automation-script-released.html "vCAC 6.1 Pre-req script").
