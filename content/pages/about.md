Hey, I am Christiaan Roeleveld and I work as a consultant for ITQ in the Netherlands. My main focus currently is Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry and everything in the CF and VMware Tanzu ecosystem. In the past I used to work a with VMware products and I still do from time to time. In the VMware world my specialization is automation. Which means I know my way around VMware vRA and vRO. You'll see that reflected in some of my older blogs.
