On March 16th the Dutch VMUG UserCon took place. Again a big event with around 1000 attendees. And again I had the honor to fill one of the breakout sessions. This year I presented with my co-worker Ruurd Keizer. Our session was titled: "The Why, What and How of Automation". In this session we talked about digitization, the differences between power tools and factories, containers, Cloud Foundry and more. The recording of our session is nowÂ available. It's in Dutch, no subtitles. But the Demos are towards the end so feel free to skip the first part if you just want to watch the awesomeness :) \[embed\]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZI6Mo0rqIo\[/embed\] This presentation also inspired a whitepaper which you can find [here](http://itq.nl/the-why-what-and-how-of-automation/).
