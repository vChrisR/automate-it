If you're working with vRealize Orhcestrator you are probably spending a lot of time in the API explorer. I find myself using it all the time. But it has some flaws and the functionality is limited. Two of my colleagues recognized that and decided to build their own vRO API Explorer. And they didn't stop there... it is now available online for everyboy to use: [vroapi.com](http://www.vroapi.com/) [![Screenshot from 2016-03-15 12:03:29](http://automate-it.today/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screenshot-from-2016-03-15-120329-300x180.png)](http://automate-it.today/vro-api-explorer/screenshot-from-2016-03-15-120329/)  It is still a work in progress but the most frequently used plugins are there. So why is it better than the build in API Explorer?

*   In my opinion the best improvement is that the search feature find a lot more than just scripting objectsÂ  and methods. It also searches types of arguments for example.
*   Everything is click-able. So it's a lot easier to navigate the API.
*   Another very nice features are the "referenced by" and "returned by" table. It tells you by which other methods that particular object is also used or returned.

*   Last but not least: It is pretty darn fast. A lot faster than the build in explorer and definitely.
