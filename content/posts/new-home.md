This blog hasn't had any activity since february of 2020. I didn't have much inspiration nor much time to write. Also, this blog was running on a hosted wordpress and kept breaking so I basically gave up for a while.

Now that I had some more time on my hands I decided it was finally time to move this blog to a new home. It's now a static site generated by hugo.io and running on github pages. Saves me a bit of money and a lot of grief not having to deal with wordpress anymore.

I managed to move all the old posts over from wordpress but I didn't take any of the images with me. So you can find old posts under "archive" but some might not look 100% ok and will be missing images.
